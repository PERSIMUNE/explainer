\title{Enhanced SHAP Analysis for Binary Classification Models}
\usage{
eSHAP_plot(
  task,
  trained_model,
  splits,
  sample.size = 30,
  seed = 246,
  subset = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{task}{mlr3 task object for binary classification}

\item{trained_model}{mlr3 trained learner object}

\item{splits}{mlr3 object defining data splits for train and test sets}

\item{sample.size}{numeric, default to 30. The larger the value, the slower but more accurate the estimate of SHAP values}

\item{seed}{numeric, an integer for reproducibility. Default to 246}

\item{subset}{numeric, what percentage of the instances to use from 0 to 1 where 1 means all}
}
\value{
A list of two objects:
\enumerate{
\item An enhanced SHAP plot with user interactive elements,
\item A matrix of SHAP values
}
}
\description{
The SHAP plot for classification models is a visualization tool that uses the Shapley value, an approach from cooperative game theory, to compute feature contributions for single predictions. The Shapley value fairly distributes the difference of the instanceâ€™s prediction and the datasets average prediction among the features. This method is available from the iml package.
