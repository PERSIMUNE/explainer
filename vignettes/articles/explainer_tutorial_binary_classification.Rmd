This is an example on how to use the package "explainer" developed by Ramtin Zargari Marandi (email:[ramtin.zargari.marandi\@regionh.dk](mailto:ramtin.zargari.marandi@regionh.dk){.email})

# Loading a dataset and training a machine learning model

This first code chunk loads a dataset and creates a binary classification task and train a "random forest" model using mlr3 package.

```{r}

Sys.setenv(LANG = "en") # change R language to English!
RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG") # change to L'Ecuyer-CMRG in case it uses default "Mersenne-Twister"

library("explainer")
# set seed for reproducibility
seed <- 246
set.seed(seed)

# set TRUE if you have dataset if not set it to FALSE
data_availablity <- FALSE

# if we have a dataset to use here


if (data_availablity==FALSE){
  # if you don't have a dataset you can try the following publicly available dataset
# load the BreastCancer data from the mlbench package
data("BreastCancer", package = "mlbench")

# keep the target column as "Class"
target_col <- "Class"

# change the positive class to "malignant"
positive_class <- "malignant"
    
# keep only the predictor variables and outcome
mydata <- BreastCancer[, -1] # 1 is ID

# remove rows with missing values
mydata <- na.omit(mydata)

# create a vector of sex categories
sex <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), size = nrow(mydata), replace = TRUE)

# create a vector of sex categories
mydata$age <- as.numeric(sample(seq(18,60), size = nrow(mydata), replace = TRUE))

# add a sex column to the mydata data frame (for fairness analysis)
mydata$sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"), labels = c(1, 0))
}

# create a classification task
maintask <- mlr3::TaskClassif$new(id = "my_classification_task",
                                  backend = mydata,
                                  target = target_col,
                                  positive = positive_class)

# create a train-test split
set.seed(seed)
splits <- mlr3::partition(maintask)

# add a learner (machine learning model base)
# library("mlr3learners")
library("mlr3extralearners")

# mlr_learners$get("classif.randomForest")
# here we use random forest for example (you can use any other available model)
mylrn <- mlr3::lrn("classif.randomForest", predict_type = "prob") # , id = "mymodel"

# train the model
mylrn$train(maintask, splits$train)

# make predictions on new data
mylrn$predict(maintask, splits$test)

```

## SHAP analysis to extract feature (variable) impacts on predictions

The following code chunk uses eSHAP_plot function to estimate SHAP values for the test set and create an interactive SHAP plot. This is an enhanced SHAP plot that means it provides additional information such as whether the predictions were correct (TP or TN). The color mapping provides enhanced visual inspection of the SHAP plot.

```{r}
# enhanced SHAP plot
SHAP_output <- eSHAP_plot(task = maintask,
           trained_model = mylrn,
           splits = splits,
           sample.size = 30,
           seed = seed,
           subset = .8)

# display the SHAP plot
SHAP_output[[1]]
```

## Visualize model performance by confusion matrix

The following code chunk uses eCM_plot function to visualize the confusion matrix for the test set in the model. More information can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix> <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cvms/vignettes/Creating_a_confusion_matrix.html>

```{r}
# enhanced confusion matrix
eCM_plot(task = maintask,
         trained_model = mylrn,
         splits = splits)
```

## Decision curve analysis

The provided code chunk employs the eDecisionCurve function to conduct "decision curve analysis" on the test set within the model. For an in-depth understanding of this methodology, interested readers are encouraged to explore the following authoritative references:

Decision Curve Analysis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_curve_analysis
"Decision curve analysis: a novel method for evaluating prediction models" by Andrew J. Vickers and Elia B. Elkin. Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2577036/
These references offer comprehensive insights into the principles and applications of decision curve analysis, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and understanding of the methodology employed in the presented code.

```{r}
# enhanced decision curve plot
eDecisionCurve(task = maintask,
         trained_model = mylrn,
         splits = splits,
         seed = seed)
```

## Model evaluation (multi-metrics and visual inspection of ROC curves)

By running the next code chunk, you will get the following model evaluation metrics and visualizations:

**AUC (Area Under the Curve):**
AUC quantifies the binary classification model's performance by assessing the area under the ROC curve, which plots sensitivity against 1-specificity across various threshold values. A value of 0.5 suggests random chance performance, while 1 signifies perfect classification.

**BACC (Balanced Accuracy):**
BACC addresses class imbalance by averaging sensitivity and specificity. Ranging from 0 to 1, a score of 0 indicates chance performance, and 1 signifies perfect classification.

**MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient):**
MCC evaluates binary classification model quality, considering true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Ranging from -1 to 1, -1 represents complete disagreement, 0 implies chance performance, and 1 indicates perfect classification.

**BBRIER (Brier Score):**
BBRIER gauges the accuracy of probabilistic predictions by measuring the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and true binary outcomes. Values range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect calibration and 1 indicating poor calibration.

**PPV (Positive Predictive Value):**
PPV, or precision, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

**NPV (Negative Predictive Value):**
NPV quantifies the proportion of true negative predictions out of all negative predictions made by the model.

**Specificity:**
Specificity calculates the proportion of true negative predictions out of all actual negative cases in a binary classification problem.

**Sensitivity:**
Sensitivity, also known as recall or true positive rate, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases in a binary classification problem.

**PRAUC (Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve):**
PRAUC assesses binary classification model performance based on precision and recall, quantifying the area under the precision-recall curve. A PRAUC value of 1 indicates perfect classification performance.

Additionally, the analysis involves the visualization of ROC and Precision-Recall curves for both development and test sets.

```{r}
eROC_plot(task = maintask,
         trained_model = mylrn,
         splits = splits)
```

## ROC curves with annotated thresholds

By running the next code chunk, you will get ROC and Precision Recall curves for the development and test sets this time with probability threshold information.

```{r}
eperformance(task = maintask,
         trained_model = mylrn,
         splits = splits)
```

## loading SHAP results for downstream analysis

Now we can get the outputs from eSHAP_plot function to apply clustering on SHAP values

```{r}
shap_Mean_wide <- SHAP_output[[2]]

shap_Mean_long <- SHAP_output[[3]]

shap <- SHAP_output[[4]]

```

## SHAP values in association with feature values

```{r}

ShapFeaturePlot(shap_Mean_long)

```

# partial dependence of features

Partial dependence plots (PDPs): PDPs can be used to visualize the marginal effect of a single feature on the model prediction.

```{r}

shapPartialPlot(shap_Mean_long = shap_Mean_long)

```

# extract feature values and predicted probabilities as output of the model to analyze

```{r}
fval_predprob <- reshape2::dcast(shap, sample_num + pred_prob + predcorrectness ~ feature, value.var = "feature.value")
```

# Run a Shiny app to visualize 2-way partial dependence plots

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
# assuming your data.table is named `fval_predprob`
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Feature Plot"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("x_feature", "X-axis Feature:",
                  choices = names(fval_predprob)),
      selectInput("y_feature", "Y-axis Feature:",
                  choices = names(fval_predprob)),
      width = 2,
      actionButton("stop_button", "Stop")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("feature_plot")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # create a reactive value for the app state
  app_state <- reactiveValues(running = TRUE)
  
  output$feature_plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(fval_predprob, aes(x = .data[[input$x_feature]], y = .data[[input$y_feature]], fill = pred_prob)) + 
      geom_tile() +
      scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue", limits = c(0, 1)) +
      xlab(input$x_feature) +
      ylab(input$y_feature) +
      labs(shape = "correct prediction") +
      egg::theme_article()
  })
  
  # observe the stop button
  observeEvent(input$stop_button, {
    app_state$running <- FALSE
  })
  
  # stop the app if the running state is FALSE
  observe({
    if(!app_state$running) {
      stopApp()
    }
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

```{r}
# This is the data table that includes SHAP values in wide format. Each row contains sample_num as sample ID and the SHAP values for each feature.
shap_Mean_wide
```

```{r}
# This is the data table of SHAP values in long format and includes feature name, mean_phi_test: mean shap value for the feature across samples, scaled feature values, shap values for each feature, sample ID, and whether the prediction was correct (i.e. predicted class = actual class)
shap_Mean_long
```

# Patient subgroups determined by SHAP clusters

SHAP clustering is a method to better understand why a model may perform better for some patients than others. Here for example, you can identify patient subgroups that have specific patterns that are different from other subgroups and that explains why the model you developed have perhaps better or worse performance for those patients than the average performance for the whole dataset. You can see the difference in the SHAP plots that if you group all together provide the overall SHAP summary plot. Again here the edges reflect how features may interact with each other in each individual sample (instance).

```{r}
# the number of clusters can be changed
SHAP_plot_clusters <- SHAPclust(task = maintask,
         trained_model = mylrn,
         splits = splits,
         shap_Mean_wide = shap_Mean_wide,
         shap_Mean_long = shap_Mean_long,
         num_of_clusters = 4,
         seed = seed,
         subset = .8)

# note that the subset must be the same value as the SHAP analysis done earlier

# display the SHAP cluster plots
SHAP_plot_clusters[[1]]

# display the confusion matrices corresponding to the SHAP clusters (patient subsets determined by SHAP clusters)
SHAP_plot_clusters[[2]]
```

# Model fairness (sensitivity analysis)

Sometimes we would like to investigate whether our model performs fairly well for different subgroups based on categories of variables such as sex.

```{r}

# you should decide what variables to use to be tested
# here we chose sex from the variables existing in the dataset

Fairness_results <- eFairness(task = maintask,
         trained_model = mylrn,
         splits = splits,
         target_variable = "sex",
         var_levels = c("Male", "Female"))

# ROC curves for the subgroups for the development (left) and test (right) sets
Fairness_results[[1]]

# performance in the subgroups for the development set
Fairness_results[[2]]

# performance in the subgroups for the test set
Fairness_results[[3]]


```

## Model parameters

```{r}
# get model parameters
model_params <- mylrn$param_set

print(data.table::as.data.table(model_params))
```
