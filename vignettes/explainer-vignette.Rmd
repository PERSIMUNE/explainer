## Introduction to Explainer Package

This vignette serves as a basic introduction to the functionalities of the Explainer package. Explainer provides a comprehensive toolkit for explaining and interpreting machine learning models.

### Functions Overview

#### SHAPclust

This function is used for SHAP clustering for binary classification models. SHAP values calculated by eSHAP_plot function are used to cluster data samples (instances) using the k-means method to identify subgroups of individuals with specific patterns of feature contributions.

#### ShapFeaturePlot

This function can be sued to plot SHAP values in association with feature values.

#### ShapPartialPlot

This function generates an interactive partial dependence plot based on SHAP values, visualizing the marginal effect of one or two features on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model.

#### eCM_plot

This function generates an enhanced confusion matrix plot using the CVMS package. The plot includes visualizations of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

#### eDecisionCurve

Decision curve analysis is a statistical method used in medical research to evaluate and compare the clinical utility of different diagnostic or predictive models. It assesses the net benefit of a model across a range of decision thresholds, aiding in the selection of the most informative and practical approach for guiding clinical decisions.

#### eFairness

This function generates Precision-Recall and ROC curves for sample subgroups, facilitating fairness analysis of a binary classification model.

#### eperformance

This function generates Precision-Recall and ROC curves, including threshold information for binary classification models.

#### eROC_plot

This function generates Precision-Recall and ROC curves for binary classification models.

#### eSHAP_plot

This function generates SHAP summary plot for classification models. It is a visualization tool that uses the Shapley value, an approach from cooperative game theory, to compute feature contributions for single predictions. The Shapley value fairly distributes the difference of the instanceâ€™s prediction and the datasets average prediction among the features. This method is available from the iml package. See the package tutorial for a working example of a binary classification model analysis.

#### eSHAP_plot_multiclass

This function is an extension to eSHAP_plot function for multiclass classification. See the package tutorial for a working example of multi-class classification model analysis.

#### eSHAP_plot_reg

This function creates a SHAP summary plot for a regression model. See the package tutorial for a working example of regression model analysis.

#### range01

This function is used to scale the data to the range of 0 to 1. It uses the Hampel filter to adjust outliers, followed by min-max normalization.

#### regressmdl_eval

This function provides calculations of measures to evaluate regression models.
